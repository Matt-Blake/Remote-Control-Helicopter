# Remote Control Helicopter 

## Description
A C program which facilitates the stable flight of a remote control helicopter attached to a HeliRig. The user has control of the helicopters altitude and yaw through PID based motor control. This program was originally designed as part of ENCE464 Assignment 1, based of code used in the ENCE361 Assignment.

## Equipment Required
+ EK-TM4C123GXL â€“ Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad with Orbit BoosterPack
+ Helicopter with PWM controllable motors


## Inputs
The target altitude is set using the Tiva board's up and down buttons. These buttons respectivly increase and decrease the altitude by 10% of the maximum altitude value. Double tapping the up button causes the helicopter to fly to the midpoint altitude (50% of maximum). This maxium altitude is set by changing the following ADC.h constant:
```c
#define VOLTAGE_DROP_ADC        1200 
```
